## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Figtree


### What I learned

In this project, I honed my skills in crafting a responsive and visually pleasing blog preview card. Using flexbox ensured adaptability to various screen sizes, while careful design considerations, like color choices and typography with the 'Figtree' font, contributed to a modern look. Adding hover effects enhanced user interaction, and semantic HTML elements improved code readability. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of combining HTML and CSS for creating functional and well-designed components.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<a href="#" class="hover-link">
  <h1>HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
</a>
```
```css
.hover-link {
    text-decoration: none;
}

.hover-link:hover h1 {
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    cursor: pointer;
}

.card-content h1 {
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    font-size: 24px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```
